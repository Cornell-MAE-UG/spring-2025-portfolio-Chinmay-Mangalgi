## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in biomechanics, materials science, and computational engineering. I’m passionate about applying analytical thinking and hands-on skills to understand how physical systems behave—especially in the context of biological tissues and mechanical testing. With experience in MATLAB, CAD, and experimental design, I enjoy working on projects that combine theory, data, and design to solve complex, real-world problems. I’m especially interested in the intersection of mechanics and intelligent systems, and I’m always looking for ways to bring thoughtful engineering to meaningful applications.
