This project involved disassembling and dissecting a HONDA WX15 engine-powered water pump. Our group analyzed both the carburetor and the centrifugal pump; I focused on the pump portion, which included disassembling the pump to inspect the impeller, seals, and internal flow paths, then analyzing how fluid moves through the pump during typical operation. This work contributed to a larger video explaining the pump’s design and fluid mechanics.

<h3>What I Did</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Disassembled the pump and identified the main internal components relevant to flow (impeller, casing, seals, and ports).</li>
  <li>Mapped fluid flow paths from inlet to outlet and related them to centrifugal pump theory.</li>
  <li>Measured port diameters to calculate specific speed and specific diameter of the pump.</li>
  <li>Summarized the pump analysis on camera as part of the final dissection and fluid mechanics explanation video.</li>
</ul>
