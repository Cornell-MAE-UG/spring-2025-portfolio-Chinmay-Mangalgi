This project was to disassemble and dissect a HONDA WX15 engine-powered water pump. Our group analyzed both the carburetor and the centrifugal pump; I performed the pump portion of the work — disassembling the pump to inspect the impeller, seals, and internal flow paths, then analyzing how fluid would flow through the pump in a normal use case. This analysis is part of the larger video discussing the pump.

Watch the video on YouTube:

What I did:

- Disassembled the pump and noted parts of the pump
- Analyzed flow paths and discussed implications for how water moves around the pump
- Summarized findings
