This project was to disassemble and dissect a HONDA WX15 engine-powered water pump. Our group analyzed both the carburetor and the centrifugal pump; I performed the pump portion of the work — disassembling the pump to inspect the impeller, seals, and internal flow paths, then analyzing how fluid would flow through the pump in a normal use case. I recorded the full dissection and a short analysis video.

You can embed the video below (already set to the video ID):

</div>

What I did:

- Disassembled the pump and documented component geometry.
- Measured key dimensions and inspected seals for wear.
- Analyzed flow paths and discussed implications for efficiency and failure.
- Summarized findings and suggested improvements.

If you'd like, I can commit this change and push it to the repo, or remove the embed and keep only the external link.
