For a class assignment, we were challenged to CAD a mechanically complex object of our choice. I decided to model a functional flashlight, focusing not just on the outer housing but also on internal components like the battery compartment, switch mechanism, and threaded cap. The goal was to create a detailed, aesthetic design that could be 3D printed or machined if needed.

This project pushed me to think carefully about how different parts interact; how threads align, how tolerances affect fit, and how real-world constraints like waterproofing and assembly order influence design choices. It was also a chance to refine my modeling workflow in Fusion and explore the balance between function and form.

I took inspiration from durable, tactical-style flashlights often used in outdoor and industrial settings. The result is a clean, modular design that could easily be adapted for different use cases or scaled for production.

One of the biggest challenges in this project was accurately modeling the threading for the flashlight cap and body. Getting the alignment right while maintaining a watertight seal required multiple iterations and careful attention to clearances. I also had to rethink how the switch mechanism would be realistically actuated, since the initial concept didn’t leave enough space for user interaction. If I were to revisit this design, I’d explore more efficient ways to integrate an LED heat sink, optimize the parting lines for easier assembly, and potentially incorporate O-ring grooves for better water resistance. This project gave me a deeper appreciation for how small design choices affect real-world usability and manufacturability. It really is not easy to create something that is so ubiquitous in our lives!
