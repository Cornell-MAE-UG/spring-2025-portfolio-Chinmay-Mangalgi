The final project for this class involved designing a torque wrench that can not only apply a specified torque but also measure it using strain gauges. Starting from a steel baseline design, I evaluated structural performance using both hand calculations and finite element analysis (FEA). To improve sensitivity and reduce weight, I selected a new material using materials indices and updated the geometry while still meeting required safety factors for strength, fracture, and fatigue. I then verified the final design in ANSYS, extracted strain at the gauge location, and confirmed that the electrical output is sufficient for accurate torque measurement. The results below summarize the design decisions and analyses used to achieve a functional, instrumented torque wrench.

The improved design uses a rectangular beam handle with dimensions h = 0.70 in (width in bending direction) and b = 0.35 in (thickness). The load is applied 16.0 in from the drive, and the strain gauges are positioned 15.0 in from the drive (1.0 in inboard from the load). A smooth 0.1 in fillet is included at the drive-handle transition to reduce stress concentrations as a design improvement. Total length of the wrench is 17 inches.

#### 2. Material Used & Mechanical Properties
Material: β-Ti alloy — Ti-12Mo-6Zr-2Fe (wrought, conservative values picked from Granta)

Young’s modulus: 13.1 × 10⁶ psi

Poisson’s ratio: 0.33

Yield strength: 130 ksi

Fracture toughness: 80.1 ksi·√in

Fatigue strength (10⁶ cycles): 90 ksi

This alloy was selected after graphing normalized yield strength vs normalized fracture tougness. 

#### 3. FEM Loads & Boundary Conditions Diagram
![Loads and Boundary Conditions](assets/images/ansysboundaryconditions.png)
The upper 0.4 in of the drive is fully constrained (fixed support, zero-displacement), per assignment instructions. This is noted by a yellow A on the top.
A lateral force equivalent to T = 600 in-lbf is applied at the load face, directed horizontally to the left to produce the design bending. This is noted by a red B on the bottom.

#### 4. Normal Strain Contours (Strain Gauge Direction)
![Normal Strain Contours](assets/images/ansysmaxnormalstress.png)
Tensile on top, compressive on the bottom, as expected. Highlighted are nodes of where the strain gauge approximately would be (node 2770), and where the true max normal strain would be, liberally assuming no stress concentrations.

#### 5. Maximum Principal Stress Contour Plot
![Principal Stress Contour](assets/images/ansysmaxprincipalstress.png)
The max principal stress is about 105 ksi at the interface of the clamped boundary and the filet. The true max principal stress is around 40-50 ksi, as shown below.

- **Maximum Normal Stress:** 38282 psi at interface of clamping and filet.

The FEM calculated strain at the exact strain gauge location is approximately 1502 microstrain, which matches the theoretical bending strain prediction.

#### 7. Torque Wrench Sensitivity (mV/V)
Using the measured FEM strain at the gauge and a half-bridge configuration:
$$\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{GF \cdot \epsilon}{2}$$
Gauge factor GF = 2.0
Output ≈ 1.5 mV/V @ 600 in-lbf, exceeding the required 1.0 mV/V sensitivity.

#### 8. Strain Gauge Selected
Strain gauge: 350 Ω linear foil gauge, 1-axis
Reference model: Omega SGD-3-350-LY13
Gauge grid length: ≈ 0.12 in (3 mm)
Grid width: ≈ 0.08–0.12 in
Overall backing: ≈ 0.25 in × 0.15 in
The wrench handle has 0.70 in of flat width, so there is ample bonding area. Gauges are aligned longitudinally to capture bending strain with one on the top thin surface (tension) and one on the bottom thin surface (compression), forming a half-bridge. This is used when calculating the sensitivity.
