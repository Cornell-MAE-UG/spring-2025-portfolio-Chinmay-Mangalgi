<p>
    For the final group work for MAE 3260, I developed a nonlinear sailboat dynamics simulator in MATLAB, including a
    <strong>PD heading controller</strong> and a full <strong>animated 2-D visualization</strong> of the boat as it tracks a waypoint.
    I wrote the simulation and animation code, which numerically integrates the system with ODE45 and animates the boat's position using coordinate transforms derived from Jacobian matrices.
